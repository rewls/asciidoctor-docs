= Add Multiple Authors to a Document
:source-highlighter: rouge
:toc: left

* The author line is the only way to assign more than one author to a document
  for display in the byline.
* Additionally, only the HTML 5 and Docbook converters can convert documents
  with multiple authors.

== Multi-author syntax

* The information for each author is concluded with a semicolon (`;`).

.Author line structure for multiple authors
[,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title
firstname middlename lastname <email>; firstname middlename lastname <email>
----

* Directly after each author's last name or optional email, enter a semicolon
  (`;`) followed by a space, and then enter the next author's information.
