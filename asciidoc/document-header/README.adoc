= Document Header
:source-highlighter: rouge
:toc: left

* An AsciiDoc document may begin with a document header.
* The document header encapsulates the document title, author and revision
  information, document-wide attributes, and other document metadata.

== Document header structure

* The optional document header is a series of contiguous lines at the start of
  the AsciiDoc source, after skipping any empty or comment lines.
* If a document has a header, _no content blocks are permitted above it_.
* In other words, the document must start with a document header if it has
  one.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* *The document header may not contain empty lines.*
* The first empty line the processor encounters after the document header
  begins marks the link:[end of the document header] and the start of the
  document body.
====

'''

* A header typically begins with a link:[Document Title].
* When a document title is specified, it may be immediately followed by one or
  two designated lines of content.
* These implicit content lines are used to assign link:[Author Information]
  and link:[Revision Information] to the document.

'''

* The header may contain the following elements as long as there aren't any
  empty lines between them:
** optional document title (a level-0 heading)
** optional author line or author and revision lines if the document title is
   present (should immediately follow the document title)
** optional document-wide attributes (built-in and user-defined) declared
   using attribute entries,
*** includes optional metadata, such as a description or keywords
** optional comment lines

* Notice in Example 1 that there are no empty lines between any of the
  entries.
* In other words, the lines are contiguous.

The document body starts here.
----
<1> Document title
<2> Author line
<3> Attribute entry assigning metadata to a built-in document attribute
<4> Attribute entry setting a built-in document attribute
<5> Attribute entry assigning a value to a user-defined document attribute
<6> The document body is separated from the document header by an empty line
====

* There are a few attribute entries in Example 1.
* Each attribute entry, whether built-in or user-defined, must be entered on
  its own line.
* While attribute entries may be placed anywhere in the header, including
  above the document title, the preferred placement is below the title, if
  it's present.
* Since the document title is optional, it's possible for the header to only
  consist of attribute entries.

== When does the document header end?

* *The first empty line in the document marks the end of the header.*
* The next line after the first empty line that contains content is
  interpreted as the beginning of the document's body.

.Terminating a document header

----
= Document Title

<1>
This is the first line of content in the document body. <2>
----
<1> An empty line ends the document header.
<2> After the empty line, the next line with content starts the body of the
document.
====

* The first line of the document body can be any valid AsciiDoc content, such
  as a section heading, paragraph, table, include directive, image, etc.
* Any attributes defined below the first empty line are not part of the
  document header and will not be scoped to the entire document.

== Header requirements per doctype

* The header is optional when the `doctype` is `article` or `book`.
* A header is required when the document type is `manpage`.
* See the link:[manpage doctype] section for manual page (man page)
  requirements.

'''

* If you put content blocks above the document header when using the default
  article doctype, you will see the following warning:

....
level 0 sections can only be used when doctype is book
....

* While this warning can be mitigated by changing the doctype to book, it
  may lead to a secondary warning about an invalid part.
* That's because the document title will be repurposed as a part title and any
  lines that follow it as content blocks.
* If you're going to use the book doctype, you must structure your document to
  use link:[Book Parts].

== Header processing

* The information in the document header is displayed by default when
  converting to a standalone document.
* If you don't want the header of a document to be displayed, set the
  `noheader` attribute in the document's header or via the CLI.

== Front matter

* Many static site generators, such as Jekyll and Middleman, rely on front
  matter added to the top of the document to determine how to convert the
  content.
* Asciidoctor has a number of attributes available to correctly handle front
  matter.
* link:[See Skip Front Matter] to learn more.
