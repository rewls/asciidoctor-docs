= Customize the Substitutions Applied to Blocks

* Each block context is associated with a set default substitutions that best
  suit the content model.
* However, there are situations where you may need a different set of
  substitutions to be applied.
* For example, you may want the AsciiDoc processor to substitute attribute
  references in a listing block.
* Therefore, the AsciiDoc language provides a mechanism for altering the
  substitutions on a block.

== The subs attribute

* The substitutions that get applied to a block (and to certain inline elements)
  can be changed or modified using the `subs` element attribute.
* This attribute accepts a comma-separated list of substitution steps or groups.

'''

* The names of those substitution steps and groups are as follows:

`none`::
** Substitution group that disables all substitutions.

`normal`::
** Substitution group that performs all substitution types except callouts.

`verbatim`::
** Substitution group that replaces special characters and processes callouts.

`specialchars`::
** Substitution step that replaces `<`, `>`, and `&` with their corresponding
   entities.
** For source blocks, this substitution step enables syntax highlighting as
   well.

`callouts`::
** Substitution step that processes callouts in literal, listing, and source
   blocks.

`quotes`::
** Substitution step that applies inline text formatting.

`attributes`::
** Substitution step that replaces attribute references.

`replacements`::
** Substitution step that replaces hexadecimal Unicode code points and entity,
   HTML, and XML character references with the characters' decimal Unicode code
   point.
** The output of replacements may depend on whether the specialcharacters
   substitution was previously applied.

`macros`::
** Substitution step that processes inline and block macros.

`post_replacements`::
** Substitution step that processes the line break character (`+`).

* If a `+` or `-` modifier is added to a step, the existing substitutions are
  modified accordingly (see incremental subs).
* Otherwise, the existing substitutions are replaced.
* The value also specifies the order in which the substitutions are applied.

[NOTE]
====
* The `subs` element attribute does not inherit to nested blocks.
* It can only be applied to a leaf block, which is any block that cannot have
  child blocks (e.g., a paragraph or a listing block).
